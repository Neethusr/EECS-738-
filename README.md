# EECS 738 Project-1. 

In this project I wrote an algorithm for the K- Nearest neighbour. In this method we classify the data based on its distance to the nearest neighbour. 
The Data set I used was the Indian liver patient data set. The data has 10 parameters. I used a subset of the data to train the data and then chose a test element 
and tried to identify if the person had a liver disease or not (i.e. the class of the data point). I used two test points, one person had a liver disease and the other person did not. In the output of the file, if the class of the data point is 1, that means the person has liver disease, and if the class of the point is 2, it implies that the person does not have liver disease.
